This are my public code repositories. They include all available public code, including various public projects I am working on or have worked on in the past.
You will find code ranging from libraries I have created, as well as fully features applications â€“ mostly written in Golang, Python, or Javascript.
Most applications you will find are web applications. Anything you find on my public repos can be used for any non-commercial purpose.

Have a nice day.
